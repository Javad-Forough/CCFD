# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection (CCFD) project developed for the WASP course "Software Engineering and Cloud Computing". This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card data using machine learning techniques.

In this project, a real-world European Credit Card Dataset has been processed and normalized to prepare it for input into the machine learning model. The subsequent step involves implementing a CCFD model based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- Precision
- Recall
- F-measure (F1)

Furthermore, the performance of the implemented ANN is visualized through the Precision-Recall (PR) curve.

## How to Run `ccfd.py`
To execute the CCFD code, follow these steps:

1. Open a command-line shell in the project directory.
2. Enter the following command:

```bash
python ccfd.py
